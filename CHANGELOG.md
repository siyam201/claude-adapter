## [2.1.2] — 2026-05-30

### Fixed

- **Logger**: Fixed simple info logging to serialize metadata on a single line for compatibility with line-oriented log collectors while ensuring consistent cyan console coloring.
- **Logger**: Resolved non-actionable logger debug comments.
- **Streaming**: Enhanced streaming tests to strictly verify that `input_tokens` is omitted from the `message_delta` event's usage object.

### Performance

- **Metadata**: Implemented an in-memory cache for `loadMetadata` to eliminate redundant synchronous disk reads, reducing lookup times from ~160ms to ~1ms.
- **XML Mode**: Switched to array accumulation and join for XML-mode user content formatting to ensure efficient O(N) allocation.

### Refactored

- **UI Module**: Refactored the `UI` module to use the central logger instead of standard `console.log`.

## [2.1.1] — 2026-04-20

### Fixed

- **Streaming**: Fixed duplicate text block stops in native streaming mode when streamed text is followed by a native tool call. This prevents duplicate assistant preamble rendering in Claude Code.
- **Streaming**: Fixed tool block index handling to ensure tool blocks close with the same index they started with.

## [2.1.0] — 2026-01-19

### Added

- **CLI**: Added `--no-claude-settings` flag to skip automatic Claude Code settings modification

---

## [2.0.0] — 2025-12-30

### Breaking Changes

- **Node.js Requirement**: Raised minimum supported Node.js version to **v20.0.0**.

### Added

- **XML Tool Calling**: Added support for models lacking native tool usage via XML injection, output parsing, and history reconstruction.
- **Deterministic Output**: Enforced `temperature: 0` and `<think>` block filtering for XML mode to ensure reliability.
- **CLI Setup**: Added interactive configuration for tool styles (`native` vs `xml`) and model capabilities.

### Fixed

- **XML History**: Resolved conversation history mismatches during multi-turn tool interactions.
- **XML Parsing**: Improved resilience against whitespace variations and case sensitivity in model outputs.

- **Update Logic**: Switched to Semantic Versioning for accurate update detection.

---

## [1.2.0] — 2025-12-22

### Added

- **Logging**: Added tracking for token usage (input/output/cache) and detailed error reporting.
- **Update System**: Added non-blocking update checks, smart upgrade prompts, and metadata storage.

### Improved

- **Performance**: Implemented zero-dependency update checks and race-safe JSON utilities to prevent CLI blocking.
